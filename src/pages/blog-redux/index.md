The last time I had a [public blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227035418/http://jeffchan.org:80/) was in high school. The blog was titled [_The Jeff Channel_](https://web.archive.org/web/20060613060009/http://jeffchan.org:80/), and [_The Geeky Jeffy Zone_](https://web.archive.org/web/20060210182733/http://jeff.rsbandb.com:80/) prior to that. Still debating whether to bring one of those names back.

I intend to write about programming, startups, engineering management, and books. Stay tuned!
